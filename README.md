# Typografier

[Typografier](https://typografier.web-dev.tools) is a tool that generates a modular & harmonious type system for modern websites.

*I use it on just about every website I create.* For me it’s an alternative to monolithic frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation.

## Taught at Algonquin Graphic Design

This modular type system is taught as part of the [Algonquin College Graphic Design](http://algonquindesign.ca) program.

This tool is introduced to the students after they learn the “long, hard, stupid way.”
